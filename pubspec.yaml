  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Kufam
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Kufam/static/Kufam-Bold.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf

    - family: Rakkas

        - asset: assets/fonts/Rakkas/Rakkas-Regular.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
